# reproducibility
main problem: heterogenous systems
 * windows, linux, old os version, mix of different already installed packages
 * switch provider, update os (even production systems for security)
 * research, share work with others
side topic: proper sharing of research
include
 * runnable code (this talk)
 * include raw data
 * (sources)
 * (reasoning)


# Introduction Stephan Porz
Data scientist @eyeo, team of 3
economics, physics, psychology
non-programming background, self-taught
used to academia, ad-hoc and one-time analyses
build business intelligence system from ground up
 * strong privacy concerns in mind

Technologies
 * unix tools, make, some python, mostly R
quick scripts, POC
 * data exploration
 * ad-hoc analyses
 * short reports
frequently run scripts, processes, production
 * dashboards (shiny)
 * data preparation
 * processing
 * aggregation
challenges
 * quickly growing requirements (the more we learn and company grows)
 * (sometimes) latest features necessary
 * rapidly developing packages
 * stability / low maintenance


# solution approaches
manual validation
don't upgrade
* bites you in the back
* logstash example
unit testing
 * will only get you so far
 * collect(n = Inf) example
 * group_by w/ arrange example
checkpoints, compare with python pip
image creation rules
pre-built images
