Reproducibility
================================================================================
```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# here goes the story from README.md
```


Why reproducibility
================================================================================
* re-use old code
* regularly run a script
* applications
* share data products with others


Excursion: proper sharing of research (and data products)
================================================================================
type: sub-section
* show evidence of result correctness
* enable others to use methods and results

**Reproducibility in Science** - [http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide](http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide)
* principles for many fields
* advice for various tasks


Heterogenous systems
================================================================================
### Various states
* OS: Windows, Mac, Linux
* OS versions: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 17.04
* R versions: R 3.0.2, R 3.3.3
* R packages: dplyr 0.5.0, tidyr 0.6.1

### Evolving systems
* update OS, R, R packages
  * features, security
* fresh installation


Background: eyeo & @data_raccoon
================================================================================
type: sub-section
### Data scientist, team of three
* economics, physics, psychology
* non-programming background, self-taught
* used to academia, ad-hoc and one-time analyses

### Building business intelligence from scratch
* strong privacy awareness

Background: technologies
================================================================================
type: sub-section
### Quick and dirty / proof of concept
* data exploration
* ad-Hoc analyses
* short reports

**almost exclusively R**

***
### Need for stability
* data parsing & cleaning
* applications (shiny-dashboards)
* frequent tasks / regular reports

**make, R, other Unix tools, Python**


Challenges
================================================================================
type: sub-section
* quickly changing & growing requirements
  * the more we learn & the company grows
* latest features allow fast progress
* rapidly developing packages
* need stability / low maintenance


Solution approaches
================================================================================
manual validation
don't upgrade
* bites you in the back
* logstash example
unit testing
 * will only get you so far
 * collect(n = Inf) example
 * group_by w/ arrange example
checkpoints, compare with python pip
image creation rules
pre-built images
