# Is R fit to create reproducible results?
## Spoiler: Yes, and here's how.
We've probably all experienced it:
We need to work with some code from over a year ago that at the time perfectly ran and yielded proper results.
Now, a bunch of OS and R updates later, everything falls to pieces.
Sometimes we get a proper error message and immediatly solve the issue.
But sometimes changes manifest in a more subtle way.
Maybe some of the results get spoiled.
Maybe this goes unnoticed until it's too late...

In this talk I'll share some of our experiences and explore various ways of how reproducibility can be achieved.
